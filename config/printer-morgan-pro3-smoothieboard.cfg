# Morgan Pro3 configuration
### NOTE: For MORGAN PRO 3 the A and B channels have been wired differently
# this was to ensure that the same software could be used in 
# Morgan Pro 2 and Pro 3, since the double arm math was based on the driving arm
# and not the tool carrying arm on Pro 2
# Stepper A is in Channel Beta and Stepper B in in Channel Alpha
# This should translate to Pro 2 as well. (now referencing the Tool arm)
